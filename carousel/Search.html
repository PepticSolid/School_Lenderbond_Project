     <h3>APR INFORMATION</h3>
     <p> Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a nominal yearly rate. It relates to the amount and timing of value received by the consumer to the amount and timing of payments made. LenderBond cannot guarantee any APR since we are not a lender ourselves. An APR can generally run between 5.99% up to 38.99%. Loan products general have a 120-day minimum repayment term and a 84-month maximum repayment term. Before accepting a loan from a lender within our network, please read the loan agreement carefully as the APR and repayment terms may differ from what is listed on this site. </p>
